when i select any single or multiple object in canvas, and press "z" on keyboard, then that should zoom to frame .... when i select ctrl+a then all the objects in canvas should select, and when i select any single or multiple object and press "delete" key on keyboard then that object should delete...

when i select any object on canvas and change any property like color or line stroke or anything , it instantly deselect that object.... actualy what i want is object shoud be in edit state continiously, for example, i can change the color by draging the cursor continiously, or apply any effect on text layer and still i can continue applying new effects and check, last effect shoud be applied
